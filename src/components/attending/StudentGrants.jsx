                <p style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Update: All available funding has now been fully allocated, and we are unable to provide any additional funding at this time. Should new funding opportunities become available, we will share an update.</p>

                <p>If you are a student interested in attending ISWC 2025, you may be eligible to apply for travel grants to support the costs of travel and lodging. This year, travel grants are funded by the Semantic Web Science Association (SWSA).</p>

                <br />
                <h2 className="h2-border-bottom">Funding Disclaimer</h2>
                <p>Please note that this is a form of financial support, not an award or prize. It is intended to assist students who do not have other means of covering their travel-related expenses. If your institution is able to fully fund your trip, we kindly ask that you refrain from applying, so that the limited resources can be directed to those with genuine financial need.</p>
