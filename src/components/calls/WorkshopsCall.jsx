                        The ISWC conference serves as the premier venue for presenting groundbreaking research, innovative systems, and application results in areas such as the Semantic Web, Knowledge Graphs, and Linked Data. Each year, ISWC attracts high-quality submissions and participants from academia and industry, bringing together researchers from diverse fields including artificial intelligence, databases, natural language processing, machine learning, information systems, human-computer interaction, and web science. These experts explore and develop cutting-edge methods and technologies to enhance the way we access, interpret, and utilize information on the Web.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Workshops at ISWC play a critical role in fostering focused, intensive scientific exchange on specific topics aligned with the conference’s overarching themes. They provide a unique venue for exploring emerging ideas, discussing novel perspectives on established research, and engaging with related research communities. We encourage proposals for workshops that will inspire meaningful dialogue and collaboration among ISWC attendees, providing a platform to advance research and innovation in this dynamic field.

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        We invite proposals for four types of workshops, each designed to foster innovation and collaboration within the Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph community:
                    </p>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-md lg:text-lg font-[300]">
                        <li><strong>Novel:</strong> Workshops focused on emerging topics that are expected to gain importance in the Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph community in the coming years. Proposers should clearly articulate why the topic is becoming increasingly significant and demonstrate its potential to attract substantial submissions and participation. Proposals will be primarily evaluated based on the timeliness of the topic and its potential for future impact.</li>
                        <li><strong>Crossover:</strong> Workshops exploring the interplay and convergence between ISWC and other research communities (e.g., “X meets Semantic Web/Knowledge Graphs”). Proposers, ideally including representatives from both communities, must explain the relevance of connecting the two fields, outline common challenges, and highlight the value of fostering collaboration between them. Proposals will be assessed on their ability to bridge scientific communities and the value of the envisioned cross-disciplinary collaboration.</li>
                        <li><strong>Established:</strong> Workshops focusing on specific aspects of Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph research that have already demonstrated the ability to attract a significant number of submissions and participants, contributing meaningfully to scientific progress. Such proposals should justify the continuation of the workshop series, highlight its focused scope, and demonstrate its ongoing impact. Proposals will be evaluated based on the arguments for continuation and evidence of past success.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Workshop proposals of all types are encouraged to promote the vitality and innovation of the Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph community.</p>

                    <h3 style={{ color: '#e94607' }} className="text-lg font-medium mt-4">Review Criteria</h3>
                    <p>
                        Workshop proposals should focus on research topics that meet the following criteria:
                    </p>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-md lg:text-lg font-[300]">
                        <li>The topic aligns with the broader scope of ISWC 2025, emphasizing Semantic Web standards and technologies, knowledge representation, and graph data models as central elements.</li>
                        <li>The proposal demonstrates a clear emphasis on a specific technology, challenge, or application area.</li>
                        <li>The topic has the potential to engage a diverse and sufficiently broad audience, including participants beyond the typical ISWC community.</li>
                        <li>The workshop format is dynamic, engaging, and well-suited for the intended audience. It incorporates interactive sessions beyond traditional paper presentations, such as roundtables, debates, Q&A sessions, roadmapping, or hackathons.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The decision to accept or reject a workshop proposal will be based on its overall quality, relevance, and potential to appeal to a substantial portion of the Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph community. Additional considerations, such as overlap with other workshop proposals, will also influence the final decision.
                    </p>
                    {/* <p>
                    Workshop proposers are also invited to have a look at the <a href="LINK_TO_CALL_FOR_CHALLENGES" style={{ color: '#e94607' }}>Call for Challenges</a> and consider if they also want to submit a challenge proposal related to the workshop topics; proposers submitting to both tracks will be asked to explicitly indicate their coordinated intention.
