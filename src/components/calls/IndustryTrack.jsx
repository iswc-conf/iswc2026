                    <p>
                        Knowledge Graphs and semantic technologies are increasingly being employed across multiple sectors, reshaping industries such as automotive, manufacturing, retail, e-commerce, media, finance, telecommunications, healthcare, life sciences, education, energy, government, intelligence, research, smart cities, and cultural heritage, among others. These technologies enhance applications by offering diverse capabilities, including business intelligence, analytics, search, content management, knowledge management, recommendation systems, information extraction, master data management, data integration, and more.

                    <h3 style={{ color: '#e94607' }} className="text-lg font-medium mt-4">New Focus on LLMs:</h3>
                    <div style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}></div>
                    <p>
                        In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for language understanding and generation. We especially encourage submissions demonstrating how semantics, knowledge graphs, and LLMs can be combined to tackle real-world industrial challenges—whether by improving data integration, automating knowledge extraction, providing semantically rich reasoning capabilities, or creating novel user experiences.
                    </p>
                    <div style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}></div>
                    <p>
                        The Industry Track welcomes your case studies of success stories, as well as insightful discussions on challenges hindering the widespread adoption of knowledge graph, semantic technologies, and LLMs in industrial applications and settings. Reports detailing the application and deployment experiences of recent research advancements to industry-relevant problems are also encouraged.
                    </p>
                    <div style={{ marginBottom: '20px' }}></div>
                    <p>
                        Submissions should focus on demonstrating the business value and impact of employing knowledge graphs and semantic technologies—potentially in conjunction with LLMs—to solve real-world industry issues, serving as a competitive differentiator. Contributions from both small and large companies are welcomed. Each submission must feature at least one author affiliated with a non-academic organization.
