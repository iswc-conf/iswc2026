                    <h3 style={{ color: '#e94607' }} className="text-lg font-medium mt-4">Tutorial Topic and Format</h3>
                    <p>
                        Tutorials are an excellent opportunity for participants to expand their expertise in a subject area: for early-career researchers, they can serve as a gateway to foundational or advanced topics, particularly those tied to research methodologies and Semantic Web technologies. For experienced researchers, tutorials can provide an avenue to refine their knowledge, acquire specialized skills, or explore new methodologies that enhance their existing research areas. For industry practitioners, these sessions can offer insights and the foundational tools needed to kickstart innovative projects and applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For ISWC attendees, we envision tutorials of the following types:
                    </p>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-md lg:text-lg font-[300]">
                        <li>Tutorials introducing core concepts and established practices in Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph domains (e.g., RDF, OWL, SPARQL, SHACL, and linked data principles) or foundational research methodologies (e.g., FAIR principles, Open Science practices).</li>
                        <li>Tutorials exploring intersections between Semantic Web/Knowledge Graph technologies and other fields (e.g., big data, machine learning, generative AI) to examine how they complement each other and the potential for innovative applications.</li>
                        <li>Tutorials focusing on cutting-edge trends, specific tools, or applications within the Semantic Web and Knowledge Graph space.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The tutorials will be held during the pre-conference days, November 2nd and 3rd, divided into four slots each day (9:00-10:40, 11:10-12:50, 14:10-15:50, 16:20-18:00). The following formats are proposed for tutorials programs:
                    </p>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-md lg:text-lg font-[300]">
                        <li><b>Half-day tutorials:</b> Two slots in either the morning or afternoon, ideal for concise, targeted introductions to a topic.</li>
                        <li><b>Full-day tutorials:</b> Covering all four slots with three breaks, designed for in-depth exploration of topics or interconnected themes, similar to a condensed course.</li>
                        <li><b>Special sessions:</b> Highly focused tutorials lasting a single slot, perfect for niche topics of significant relevance or timeliness, often led by recognized experts or authoritative figures in the field.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Tutorials should be dynamic and engaging, avoiding exclusively lecture-based formats. At least half of the session time should involve interactive elements, such as hands-on activities, group discussions, or collaborative exercises.
                    </p>

                    <p className="text-md lg:text-lg font-light">
                        Accepted tutorials will be required to create a dedicated tutorial webpage that provides detailed information about the program and any relevant materials that participants may need to download or review prior to or during the event. The suggested timeline for setting up the webpage is outlined in the “Important dates” section.
                    </p>
                    <p>For tutorials involving software or online services, the following guidelines are strongly recommended:</p>

                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-md lg:text-lg font-[300]">
                        <li>
                            Clear prerequisites and step-by-step instructions for downloading/installing software or registering for online services should be made available on the tutorial webpage well in advance. This ensures participants have sufficient time to prepare before the tutorial begins.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Allocate time at the beginning of the tutorial to guide participants through any necessary installation or registration processes. Organisers should not assume that all attendees will arrive fully prepared.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Develop a contingency plan to address potential issues such as limited Wi-Fi bandwidth (e.g., providing USB drives with large files) or the unavailability of online services (e.g., pre-recorded videos of demonstrations).
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p className="text-md lg:text-lg font-light">
                        All tutorial presenters are required to register for the conference by the early bird registration deadline and attend the tutorial in person.

                    <p>
                        The tutorial and workshop track chairs reserve the right to cancel tutorials if the organisers fail to complete the registration process in a timely manner.
