                        Inspired by the Special Session at ISWC 2024 and the Dagstuhl Seminar model, these workshops are designed to encourage in-depth discussions on challenges or emerging topics within a half-day or full-day event format. The goal is to create a collaborative and open environment for brainstorming and exploring new directions, similar to the spirit of Dagstuhl Seminars. These workshops will prioritize dynamic discussions and the presentation of fresh ideas and ongoing research, rather than requiring participants to submit papers or give formal presentations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Proposers should focus on assembling a diverse group of core participants who are expected to attend this workshop, including senior researchers, early-career researchers, and practitioners. The workshop will be open to all attendees of the conference. The workshop structure should enable open dialogue and interdisciplinary exchange, ensuring an optimal group size for meaningful interaction. While shorter than traditional Dagstuhl Seminars, these workshops should emulate their emphasis on fostering creativity, collaboration, and innovation in a relaxed yet focused setting. This is ultimately a WORKshop.

                        The Dagstuhl-style workshops proposal should include the following sections:
                        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-md lg:text-lg font-[300]">
                            <li><b>Workshop Title and Acronym</b></li>
                            <li><b>Workshop Type:</b> Indicate whether the workshop is novel or established.</li>
                            <li><b>Proposed Length:</b> Specify whether the workshop will be half-day or full-day.</li>
                            <li><b>Abstract:</b> Provide a concise 200-word summary describing the purpose of the workshop.</li>
                            <li><b>Topics:</b> Specify the topics of interest that will be covered. Proposals should focus on a specific and selective theme, more narrow than the main conference's broader scope. Proposals with significant thematic overlap with others may be merged or rejected.</li>
                            <li><b>Chairs:</b> Provide the names, affiliations, email addresses, homepages, and short biographies of each chair. Highlight their expertise in the workshop topic and their experience organizing relevant events. Proposals should have multiple chairs (ideally from different institutions) to ensure diverse perspectives. A maximum of five organizers is recommended, with a balance of junior and senior researchers.</li>
                            <li><b>Organisational Requirements:</b>  List any specific equipment needed beyond standard projectors (e.g., poster stands, boards, markers). Workshop proposers are encouraged to bring their own materials if necessary, as equipment availability will be confirmed with local organizers.</li>
                            <li><b>Motivation and Objectives:</b> Highlight the key challenges or emerging topics the workshop seeks to address. Explain the importance and timeliness of the topic for the Semantic Web, Knowledge Graph, and related communities.</li>
                            <li><b>Expected Results/Outcomes:</b> Explain what are the expected results and outcomes of this workshop, and how you expect to achieve them.</li>
                            <li><b>Workshop Format:</b> Describe the structure of the workshop. Dagstuhl-style workshops should prioritize open discussions, brainstorming, and collaborative sessions rather than formal presentations. For example, are there a set of research questions that the organizers would like to cover? Or are the topics based on position statements submitted by expected attendees? Or is this an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_space_technology" target="_blank" style={{ color: '#e94607' }}>Open Spaces</a> approach? Provide a tentative schedule showcasing activities like group discussions, breakout sessions, and plenary dialogues.</li>
                            <li><b>Target Audience and Participation:</b> Specify the intended mix of participants, including senior researchers, early-career researchers, and practitioners. Explain how diverse expertise and perspectives will contribute to the workshop’s success.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
