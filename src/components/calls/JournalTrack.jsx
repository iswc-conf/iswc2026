                    <p>ISWC 2025 is iterating on the historical Journal Track. This year, we are soliciting a call for (journal track) sessions. These sessions will be held during the main track of the conference.</p>

                    <p>We want to facilitate cross-pollination between sub-communities, as well as overall strengthen the ties and pipelines between ISWC and the journals that serve our community.</p>

                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Eligibility</h2>


                    <p>This track is open to any journal related to the Semantic Web or the principled use of related artifacts (e.g., ontologies, semantics, or semantic technologies). Proposal authors should be editors of the journal, and if they are not editors in chief, then should be submitted under their auspices.</p>

                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Session Format Guidance</h2>

                    <p>A session should be considered to be 90 minutes long. The session’s internal organization is up to the proposer. However, we encourage that the session proposal has a coherent theme, or that the Editors have otherwise curated a selection of timely, impactful, or prescient papers from their journal’s recent issues.</p>

                    <h3 style={{ color: '#e94607' }} className="text-md font-medium mt-3">Proceedings</h3>

                    <p>To encourage participation and otherwise facilitate attendance, there is capacity for inclusion in the ISWC proceedings and event – beyond the presentation during the proposed session.</p>

                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-md lg:text-lg font-[300]">
                        <li>Journal Spotlight – Companion Proceedings</li>
                        <ul className="list-disc ml-16 text-md lg:text-lg font-[300]">
                            <li>This is an optional venue, where the proposers may opt-in so that presenters may have some publication, which allows for attendance. Ideally, all presenters would provide a contextualization of their presented journal article. Ideally, the proposers (i.e., the editors) would provide an editorial-style introduction which discusses the entire session and its context.</li>
                            <li>This is currently anticipated to be a CEUR volume.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>First-come, first-serve slots at the Poster & Demo session</li>

                            <li>This must be communicated clearly, so that space can be reserved.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Review Criteria</h2>

                    <p>The organizing committee will consider the organization of the session, as well as the selected papers for presentation and discussion. Therefore, proposers <strong>must ensure unfettered access to the selected papers</strong> both during the review process and to attendees of the conference (at least during the conference duration). All submissions will be evaluated along the following review criteria:</p>
