                    <p>
                        The International Semantic Web Conference is the premier venue for presenting fundamental research, innovative technology, and applications concerning semantics, data, and the Web.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The research track of ISWC 2025 solicits novel and significant research contributions addressing theoretical, analytical, and empirical aspects of the Semantic Web. We welcome work describing original and replicable research showing evidence of significant contribution to the Semantic Web.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All papers will be assessed by the track’s program committee. Each paper will be reviewed by at least three committee members, with a meta-review provided by a senior member. The review criteria used are <span onClick={() => scrollToSection(review_ref)} style={{ color: theme.colors.accent, textDecoration: "underline"}}>outlined below</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As ISWC 2025 features multiple tracks, authors are asked to consult the calls of the other tracks to choose the track that best fits their contribution. The submission of the same work to multiple tracks (as well as other conferences) is not allowed and results in a rejection of the work without review.
                    </p>

                   <SubHeader>Review Criteria</SubHeader>

                    <p>Papers in this track will be reviewed according to the following criteria:</p>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-md lg:text-lg font-[300]">
                        <li>Originality and novelty</li>
                        <li>Relevance of the topic to the conference</li>
                        <li>Impact of the research contributions</li>
                        <li>Technical soundness</li>
                        <li>Rigor and reproducibility of the work (including evaluation)</li>
                        <li>Clarity and quality of presentation</li>
                        <li>Grounding in the literature</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Any submissions that are clearly out of scope, or have significant omissions with respect to these criteria may be subject to desk-rejection prior to a full review. Guidelines for reviewers are available <ExternalLInk href="https://iswc2025.semanticweb.org/#/guidelines/review" >here</ExternalLInk>.</p>

                    <SubHeader>Rebuttal</SubHeader>

                    <p>Authors will have the chance to provide a response to the reviews during a rebuttal period that precedes the reviewer discussion period. The SPCs and PC Chairs will consider the authors' responses to the points raised by the reviewers.</p>

                   <SubHeader>Supplemental Material Statement and Reproducibility</SubHeader>
                    <p>Reproducibility is a key goal of scientific research. We require authors of all papers to include a statement at the end of their submission that facilitates the independent reproducibility or verification of the results presented (where relevant), pointing to where supplemental material can be found. These resources may include datasets, queries, code, proofs of results, configuration details, hyperparameters, etc., depending on the contributions of the paper. The statement should cover all of the resources necessary to reproduce or verify the results presented in the paper, indicating their persistent identifiers (e.g., DOI). In case certain resources cannot be made available (e.g., due to privacy, ethical, or financial concerns), the statement should include a justification of why this is the case. In case the paper is fully self-contained and does not have additional resources associated (e.g., a theoretical paper with full proofs contained in the body of the paper), a short statement can be provided arguing that the paper is self-contained. Please see the  <ExternalLInk href="https://iswc2025.semanticweb.org/#/guidelines/supplemental">Supplemental Material Statement Guide</ExternalLInk> for more details.</p>

                    <p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate the statement. In particular, they will be asked to ensure that the statement convinces them that the results of the paper are reproducible, to ensure that the resources are indeed available and support reproducibility (both now and for the foreseeable future), and, in cases where resources are not provided, to verify that there is a reasonable justification. Unless otherwise justified, it is expected that access to resources is provided from the submitted paper since these resources may often play an important role in the review process. All resources must be provided anonymously; please see the “Supplemental Material” section for recommended options.</p>

                    <SubHeader>Instructions for Dual Anonymous Reviewing</SubHeader>
                    <p>Reviewing for ISWC 2025 is dual-anonymous, i.e., the identities of the authors and reviewers are hidden. Both authors and reviewers are expected to make every effort to honor this process. Authors should do their best to ensure that the submission can be evaluated without it being obvious who wrote the paper, and reviewers should not undertake any investigation with the specific goal of revealing the authors’ identity.</p>

                    <p>To help with the dual anonymous reviewing process please ensure the following when submitting to ISWC 2025:</p>
                    <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-md lg:text-lg font-[300]">
                        <li>The first page, on which the paper body begins, should include the title and abstract but not the names or affiliations of the authors.</li>
                        <li>Remove any identifying information, including author names, from file names and ensure document properties are also anonymized.</li>
                        <li>Remove any identifying information from your paper resources such as datasets, models, or code (e.g., README and package files in code repositories, Zenodo deposits, etc.)</li>
                        <li>The references should include all published literature relevant to the paper. When referring to one’s own work, use the third person, rather than the first person. For example, say “Previously, Foo [4] showed that…,” rather than “In our previous work [4] we showed that…”</li>
                        <li>Try to avoid including any information that would identify the authors or their affiliations. Such information may be added to the final camera-ready version for publication.</li>
                        <li>Remove references to funding sources and/or acknowledgments. Such information should be included in the final camera-ready version for publication.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <SubHeader> Supplemental Material </SubHeader>

                    <p>The length of the main submission is strictly limited as indicated in the call for papers. However, authors may choose to also submit supplemental material, which may include proofs of theorems that are stated in the main paper, video demonstrations, data concerning experimental evaluations, source code, and so on. Note that submissions may reference the supplemental material for further details, but should be self-contained. Reviewers are instructed to make their evaluations based on the main submission and are not obligated to consult the supplemental material. Therefore, make sure that your submission stands on its own without them.</p>
                    <p>Please take care not to violate the dual anonymous review requirements in the supplemental material. You may make supplemental material available per one of the following options:</p>
                    <ul className="list-disc ml-16 text-md lg:text-lg font-[300]">
                        <li><strong>OPTION 1:</strong> As an anonymized link to supplemental material included in the paper. This option may be used, in particular, in case the total size of the submission (paper+supplemental materials) exceeds 100MB. We recommend the use of Github, Zenodo, Figshare, or Dryad. Anonymous dataset submissions can be managed through Zenodo and Figshare without additional accounts; see, for example, <a href="https://github.com/dgraziotin/disclose-data-dbr-first-then-opendata" target="_blank" style={{ color: '#e94607' }}>this guide</a> by Daniel Graziotin. Code repository submissions may be anonymized through platforms like <a href="https://anonymous.4open.science/" target="_blank" style={{ color: '#e94607' }}>https://anonymous.4open.science/</a>.</li>
                        <li><strong>OPTION 2:</strong> As a second zipped folder uploaded via the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iswc2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{ color: '#e94607' }}>EasyChair</a> system; note that the total size of the submission (paper+supplemental materials) must not exceed 100MB.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Supplemental material submitted at the time of submission for review will not be automatically published or posted if the paper is accepted for publication. Hence we expect authors of accepted papers choosing OPTION 2 to publish this material in one of the aforementioned repositories (or arXiv in the case of an extended version of the paper with proofs) and provide references to the supplemental material in the final camera-ready version of the paper.</p>
                    <p>In the case of both options, we strongly encourage making supplemental material available under open licenses and providing sufficient documentation to enable reproducibility.</p>

                    <SubHeader>Prior Publication and Multiple Submissions</SubHeader>
                    <p>ISWC 2025 will not accept research papers that, at the time of submission, are under review for or have already been published in, or accepted for publication, in a journal or another conference. Please refer to and adhere to the <a href="https://iswc2025.semanticweb.org/#/guidelines/prior-publications" target="_blank" style={{ color: '#e94607' }}>ISWC Prior Publication and Multiple Submission Policy.</a></p>
