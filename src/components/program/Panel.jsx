                    <p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to reshape the landscape of artificial intelligence, the role of symbolic representation, once central to knowledge modeling and reasoning, faces renewed scrutiny and exciting possibilities.</p>
                    <p>This panel, "Reimagining Knowledge: The Future and Relevance of Symbolic Representation in the Age of LLMs," brings together leading thinkers at the intersection of machine learning, knowledge engineering, and AI in the broader sense to explore the evolving relationship between symbolic and machine-learning paradigms. Through a multidisciplinary dialogue, panelists will examine whether symbolic structures remain essential for interpretability, reasoning, and alignment in modern AI systems or if they are being eclipsed by the impressive but opaque capabilities of LLMs.</p>

                    <p>Ora Lassila, Principal Technologist at  Amazon Web Services and co-chair of the W3C RDF-star Working Group</p>
                    <p>Ora Lassila is a Principal Technologist in the Amazon Neptune graph database team and the co-chair of the W3C RDF-star Working Group. He was one of the creators of the original Semantic Web vision and was a co-author of the original RDF specification. His main interest is to make people understand that sharing data is not just about sharing the physical bits but also sharing the meaning of those bits, and he sees ontologies and knowledge graphs as a means to do that. He is also interested in improving the alignment between RDF graphs and Labeled Property Graphs.</p>
