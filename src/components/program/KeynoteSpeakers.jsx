                    <SubHeader>Large Language Models and the AI Divide: Challenges and Pathways for Globally Equitable AI</SubHeader>
                    <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a defining technology of our time, promising to transform knowledge access, communication, and productivity. Yet, their development and governance remain concentrated in a handful of institu- tions and geographies, raising critical questions about equity, justice, and global power. For Africa and the wider Global Majority, LLMs present a paradox: they hold the potential to expand access to information, enable innovation in local languages, and support inclusive development, but they also risk deepening ex- isting asymmetries of data, infrastructure, and governance.</p>

                    <p>In this talk, I will explore the limitations and challenges of LLMs as they intersect with African and Global Majority contexts. I will highlight three critical areas of concern: (1) the epistemic exclusions embedded in training data that marginalize local knowledge systems and languages; (2) the infrastructural and resource dependencies that make access costly and uneven; and (3) the governance gaps that allow external models and actors to shape socio-technical futures with limited accountability to local communities. To move beyond critique, this talk will also outline pathways for governance and intervention that can help ensure LLMs are used to empower rather than exploit. These include developing regionally grounded ethical frameworks, advancing open and locally adapted models, building public—private research collaborations, and embedding fairness and transparency into technical standards. Crucially, it calls for a re-imagining of AI governance not merely as risk mitigation, but as an opportunity to redis- tribute power, democratize innovation, and foreground the values of justice and dignity in technological futures.</p>

                    <h2 style={{ color: '#e94607' }} className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Building Safety on Large Language Model</h2>
                    <p>I will introduce the activities on AI Safety, mostly conducted at the Research and Development Center for Large Language Models, National Institute of Informatics (NII-LLMC). At our institute, we are developing LLM from scratch (i.e., from pre-training) in order to ensure transparency through elucidation of the learning principles of generative AI models, and carry out R&D that contributes to the advancement of generative AI models. Safety is one of the most crucial components, and the technologies to embody the safety will be educational for many industrial partners developing LLMs. We will introduce AnswerCarefully, a  dataset for promoting the safety and appropriateness of Japanese LLM outputs. The dataset consists of 1,800 pairs of questions and reference answers, where the questions require special attention in answering. It covers a wide range of risk categories established in prior English language datasets, but the data samples are original in that they are manually created to reflect the socio-cultural context of LLM usage in Japan. We show that using this dataset for instruction to fine-tune a Japanese LLM led to improved output safety without compromising the utility of general responses. We also report the results of a safety evaluation of 12 Japanese LLMs using this dataset as a benchmark. Finally, we describe the latest update on the dataset, which provides English translations and annotations of the questions, aimed at facilitating the derivation of similar datasets in different languages and regions. We will also introduce other activities, including the development of a misinformation and disinformation dataset, Jailbreak data set, fine-tuning and DPO tuning for safety, a large human evaluation experiment, and so on.</p>

                        Satoshi Sekine is a professor at the Large Language Model Research and Development Center at the National Institute of Informatics, Japan. He received PhD at New York University in 1998. He has been working on Natural Language Processing, in particular Information Extraction, Named Entity, Question Answering, and, most recently development of data for LLM, and other related topics. He has his own research venture, LanguagrCraft, and has been working with different companies as a regular employee or a visitor, including Panasonic, SONY-CSL, Microsoft Research, and Rakuten, among others.

                    <p>In 2005, the very first papers proposed integrating Semantic Web technologies in the nascent Wikipedia ecosystem. This wasn’t just a convergence; it ignited two decades of mutual inspiration and benefit. From this crucible, the work in semantic wikis drew inspiration. Semantic MediaWiki particularly, which found global adoption at Google, Microsoft, NASA, and beyond. Wikipedia became the bedrock for pioneering knowledge graphs, including DBpedia, Freebase, and Yago. These pivotal experiences directly fueled the development of Google’s Knowledge Graph, a term that has since found ubiquitous adoption, and, critically, Wikidata, a project that has become an indispensable, living component of Wikipedia itself. With over half a million global contributors, Wikidata stands as the world’s most-edited wiki, powering one of, if not the, most widely-used public SPARQL endpoint. Its software, Wikibase, has spawned a federation of knowledge graphs, serving diverse domains from museums to language preservation. Furthermore, Wikidata’s evolution into lexicographic data (inspired by ontologies such as OntoLex and Lemon) laid the groundwork for projects such as Wikifunctions and Abstract Wikipedia, a vision first unveiled right here at ISWC 2018 and now an ocial Wikimedia Foundation project.</p>
                    <p>This takes us to the present and future: Abstract Wikipedia collaboratively confronts the inherent expressivity gap in knowledge graphs, while Wikipedia’s foundational role in training and the current use of language models can not be overstated. This creates a tantalising confluence of large language models and knowledge graphs, hinting at profound opportunities - and critical challenges - for Wikipedia, the Web, and beyond. As this rich history promises many more years of co-development and mutual inspiration, we will conclude with a forward-looking sketch of open research questions and exciting upcoming opportunities.</p>
